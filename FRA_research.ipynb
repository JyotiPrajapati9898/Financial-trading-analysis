Model Performance:\n","#    - Evaluate R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and other metrics from the model summary.  A higher adjusted R-squared indicates a better fit, considering the number of predictors.\n","#    - Consider the p-values for the coefficients.  High p-values (typically > 0.05) suggest the corresponding predictor may not be statistically significant.\n","#    - Examine the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Lower values indicate better prediction accuracy.\n","\n","# 2. Residual Analysis:\n","#   - The residual plot should show a random scatter around zero. Patterns in the plot, such as a funnel shape or curves, indicate heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance) or non-linearity, violating assumptions of the linear regression model.\n","#   - The Q-Q plot helps to assess the normality of residuals.  Significant deviations from the diagonal line suggest non-normality.\n","\n","# 3. Multicollinearity:\n","#    - The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) helps identify multicollinearity among predictor variables.  High VIF values (generally > 5 or 10) indicate potential multicollinearity, which can destabilize coefficient estimates.\n","\n","\n","# Model Improvement Strategies\n","\n","# 1. Address Multicollinearity:\n","#    - If high VIFs are present, consider:\n","#       - Removing one or more of the highly correlated predictors.\n","#       - Combining correlated variables into a single composite variable.\n","#       - Using regularization techniques (Ridge or Lasso regression).\n","\n","\n","# 2. Transform Variables:\n","#    - If residual plots show non-linearity or heteroscedasticity, consider transformations of the variables (e.g., logarithmic, square root).\n","\n","# 3. Feature Engineering:\n","#   - Explore creating new features from existing ones.  For example, interaction terms between predictors or other relevant financial ratios.\n","\n","\n","# 4. Consider Other Models:\n","#    - If linear regression assumptions are severely violated, explore alternative models like:\n","#       - Random Forest\n","#       - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)\n","#       - Support Vector Regression (SVR)\n","#       - Neural Networks\n","\n","# 5.
